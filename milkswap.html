                    looking for a non-dairy option to add to your hot drink, <a href="#hot-drinks">scroll down</a> to

        <h2 class="resources-h2">Almond Milk</h2>
        <p>Almond milk is a plant milk made from almonds. It usually has a creamy texture and a nutty flavour from the
            almonds, although some types or brands are flavoured to imitate the taste of cow’s milk. It doesn’t contain
            any cholesterol, is low in saturated fat and, as it doesn’t contain dairy, is lactose-free. It’s naturally
            rich in vitamin E, and commercially produced milks are usually fortified with vitamin D and calcium. It’s
            also very easy to <a href="https://minimalistbaker.com/how-to-make-almond-milk/">make your own almond
                milk</a> at home - it uses just two ingredients and takes less than ten minutes.
            <br><br>Almond milk is a very easy switch for cow’s milk in smoothies, overnight oats, desserts and as milk
            for cereal.
            <br><br>Generally speaking, almond milk is interchangeable with cow’s milk when cooking, and you shouldn’t
            notice a flavour difference - although it comes in sweetened and unsweetened varieties, so be sure to choose
            the right one for your needs!
            <br><br>Baking can be a little more tricky, as these recipes are quite precise. If a recipe has been created
            using almond milk you don’t need to make any changes, but if it’s been created and tested using cow’s milk,
            you can still use almond milk but you might notice some changes in appearance and texture. Experimentation
            is the key!
            <br><br>Taste-wise, it can be a delicious switch for cow’s milk in coffee, but be sure to check our tips for
            plant milks in hot drinks!
        </p>
        <h2 class="resources-h2">Oat Milk</h2>
        <p>Oat milk is made from whole oat grains mixed with water. It has a creamy texture and a mild oatmeal-like
            flavor. Like many plant milks, it’s made in a range of flavors and available in sweetened and unsweetened
            varieties.
            <br><br>It’s a relevant newcomer to the plant milk family, developed in the 1990s by a Swedish scientist.
            It’s popularity has been quick to grow and, as of late 2020, oat milk was second only to almond milk, in the
            United States.
            <br><br>It has only 10% of the saturated fat content of cow’s milk and is naturally high in fibre.
            Commercial oat milk is also commonly fortified with vitamins A, D, B12 and calcium.
            <br><br>Oat milk is a popular substitute for milk in coffee, and as an alternative to dairy yoghurts and ice
            creams. It’s a favourite of baristas, who claim that oat milk needs less steam than cow milk, froths well,
            has a rich, creamy taste, and balances the acidity of espresso coffee.
            <br><br>Oat milk is another very easy milk to <a href="https://minimalistbaker.com/make-oat-milk/">make at
                home</a>, using just two ingredients, a blender, and five minutes of your time.
            <br><br>You can use oat milk in the same way you’d use dairy on breakfast cereals, porridge and oatmeal, and
            can stir the unsweetened variety into soups and mashed potatoes. You can’t use oat milk in place of heavy
            creams, as it doesn’t whip well, and you the general advice is to, unless you’re using a dairy-free recipe,
            avoid using it in cheesy dishes.
            <br><br>But it’s an easy substitute for baking, and can typically be swapped one for one with dairy milk -
            just be sure to shake the oat milk well before using so that everything is blended and you can enjoy the
            full smooth, creamy texture of the milk.
        </p>
        <h2 class="resources-h2">Coconut Milk</h2>
        <p>Coconut milk is an opaque, milky-white liquid with a rich taste that comes from the grated pulp of coconuts.
            It has a high oil content, most of which is saturated fat, and is available as a coconut cream, coconut
            milk, and as a diluted coconut milk beverage. These diluted milks, designed for drinking, are naturally high
            in potassium, fibre and iron, and are also often fortified with vitamin D and calcium.
            <br><br>Coconut creams and milks are used in many Southeast Asian and African dishes. They’re particularly
            delicious in curries and can be used in place of dairy milk and cream in soups. Coconut milks (both the
            fattier version and the diluted beverage) can be whizzed with fruit and berries to make tasty smoothies
            <br><br>Coconut milk is a pretty great substitute for dairy when cooking - you can substitute 6%-fat coconut
            milk one for one in most recipes that call for full-fat milk. Just be aware that it will bring a coconut
            flavour to your dish or baked goods! It can also be used to make <a
                href="https://cnz.to/recipes/basics/homemade-coconut-milk-yogurt-recipe/">homemade yoghurt</a>, and
            instant ice cream - just a couple of frozen bananas, a handful of frozen berries and 150ml of coconut milk
            into a food processor!
            <br><br>Coconut cream can be whipped into a delicious non-dairy topping for cakes and pancakes too - just
            refrigerate a can overnight and whip it with a little sugar.
        </p>
        <h2 class="resources-h2">Soya Milk</h2>
        <p>Soya milk, also known as soy milk, is a plant-based drink originating in China, made by soaking, grinding and
            bolling soybeans. It has an oatmeal- like, nutty flavour and is a good source of protein, and is commonly
            fortified with vitamins A, B and D, calcium and
            magnesium.
            <br><br>Soya is also one of the best non-animal sources of healthy omega-3 fatty acids, which are healthy
            fats linked to a reduced risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.
            <br><br>Soya milk is used in a wide range of imitation dairy products such as soy creams, yoghurts and
            cheeses. It also comes in sweetened and unsweetened varieties and a range of flavours - vanilla, chocolate,
            strawberry, the list goes on.
            <br><br>It’s very versatile and can be added to smoothies, eaten with cereal, and used in sauces and
            curries. Like coconut milk, it can generally be substituted for dairy milk in most recipes for baked goods.
            <br><br>Many people find soy milk one of the best plant milks to add to hot drinks, as it generally doesn’t
            curdle.
        </p>
        <a id="hot-drinks"><h2>Plant Milks in Hot Drinks</h2></a>
        <p>Pairing plant milks with coffee and tea is a question of taste but you do also need to consider that some
            will curdle when added to hot drinks. Many commercial brands, like Oatly, make barista versions of their
            plant milks for this reason.
            <br><br>Otherwise, to avoid curdling, try gently heating your plant milk before stirring into your beverage.
