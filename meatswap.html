                </span>
                <p>
                    When it comes to meat, there are important key points to consider. <br>
                    <b>The texture: </b>meat tends to have a rather dense texture that sticks together and does not
                    break easily.<br>
                    <b>Taste: </b>they are many different ways of replicating the taste of meat, from the smoky flavor
                    of bacon to the saltiness of chicken.<br>
                    <b>Nutrients: </b>Despite the popular perception that meat is a great source of protein, there is a
                    wide variety of plant-based food that can provide a fair supply of protein.
                </p>

        <h2 class="resources-h2">Tofu, Tempeh and Seitan</h2>
        <p>Tofu, Tempeh and Seitan are THE reference for swapping your meat with a plant-based alternative. This is due
            to the fact that all 3 key criteria (taste, texture and nutrients) are met.
            You can season them with any sauce and spice, and you can really become creative to make them as close
            as possible to animal meat. The possibilities are endless!<br>
            Tofu and Tempeh are produced from soy, but have a complete different texture. Tempeh tends to be firmer and closer to red meat texture. Seitan is produced from wheat and gluten.
        </p>
        <h2 class="resources-h2">Lentils</h2>
        <p>Lentils in any shape or form are a great substitute to mince meat. It will fufill your meat crave and it offers a greater taste. I almost forgot to mention: it is full of protein too!<br>
            A very simple dish where to use the lentils for example could be the bolognese sauce: add carrots, celery, oignon, garlic, mushrooms, tomato sauce (passata or other) and lentils. All you will have to do is ENJOY!
        </p>
        <h2 class="resources-h2">Jackfruit</h2>
        <p>The jackfruit is: a fruit! However it has a quite neutral taste and is often used in savoury dishes. With a stringy texture, it is often used as a substitute to pulled pork or chicken. The only down side of the jackfruit is that it is not easy to find and does not have a high value in protein.
        </p>
        <h2 class="resources-h2">Chickpeas, Peas and Beans</h2>
        <p>Chickpeas, peas and beans are really interesting to use in dishes for their numerous positive nutrients and also for their protein content. They can be used in their original form, or combined to other ingredients to replicate meat. For example in burger patties!
        </p>
        <h2 class="resources-h2">Mushrooms</h2>
        <p>Mushrooms has it own taste which will be difficult to tranform into a meat flavour. However if mixed with nuts and other ingredients, the texture can be very close to meat. For example in a mushroom wellington for a good sunday roast.
